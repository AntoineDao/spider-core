### Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to Spider-Core? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Do check the local development section of these tutorials in case you haven't really used NodeJS much before or aren't too familiar with Eslint or JSDoc.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Spider-Core's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Spider-Core
- Enable a sustainable system for Spider-Core's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow the [styleguides](./tutorial-styleguide.html)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
